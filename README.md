## Project Goal

'Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness due to the alterations of a protein called dystrophin that helps keep muscle cells intact'. 

([Muscular Dystrophy Association](https://www.mda.org/disease/duchenne-muscular-dystrophy) - Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) - Diseases (2021, April 29))

Approximatly 4.78 people out of 100,000 poccess the DMD in the world. To help those people improve their autonomy, we decided to create a robotic arm, accessible and customizable. Our goal was to create an arm, controllable with android app, and under a 400â‚¬ budget, with a 3D printer. 

This project was possible thanks to [Niryo](https://niryo.com/fr/)'s 3D models of the arm, the FabLab of [ECE Paris](https://www.ece.fr/) school and [HandiTech](https://handitech-france.fr/).

The usage of the arm is under the responsability of the user.
